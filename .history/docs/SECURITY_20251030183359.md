# SECURITY.md - ORUS Builder

## Security Policy

ORUS Builder takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

---

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

---

## Response Timeline

We aim to:
- **Acknowledge** your report within **48 hours**
- **Provide initial assessment** within **1 week**
- **Release patch** within **2-4 weeks** (depending on severity)
- **Public disclosure** after patch is released

---

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Examples | Timeline |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data leak | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | XSS, CSRF, SQL injection | 1-2 weeks |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | 2-4 weeks |
| **Low** | Minor issues, best practice violations | Next release |

## Security Practices

### CIG Protocol Security
- ‚úÖ All generated code is type-safe (no runtime type coercion)
- ‚úÖ Input validation on all API endpoints
- ‚úÖ CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting to prevent brute force
- ‚úÖ API key rotation recommended every 90 days

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- ‚úÖ Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data in logs
- ‚úÖ Secure session management
- ‚úÖ Regular security audits

### Infrastructure Security
- ‚úÖ CORS properly configured
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ‚úÖ XSS protection (Content Security Policy)
- ‚úÖ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ Regular security updates

### API Security
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Always validate input
if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid email');
}

// ‚úÖ Use parameterized queries
const user = await db.query(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?',
  [email]
);

// ‚úÖ Never expose sensitive info
const response = {
  id: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  // ‚ùå Never return: password, tokens, or API keys
};
```

## Dependencies Security

We:
- ‚úÖ Use `npm audit` regularly
- ‚úÖ Update dependencies promptly
- ‚úÖ Use Snyk for continuous monitoring
- ‚úÖ Have automated dependency checks in CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Review all major updates before deploying

**You should:**
```bash
# Check your local dependencies
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Or manually update
npm update
```

---

## Environment Security

### Never Commit
```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER commit these to GitHub
.env
.env.local
private-key.pem
credentials.json
secrets.json
```

### Manage Secrets
```bash
# ‚úÖ Copy the template
cp .env.example .env

# ‚úÖ Edit with your secrets
nano .env

# ‚úÖ Keep it in .gitignore (already done)
```

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is a strong random string (40+ characters)
- [ ] All API keys from trusted sources
- [ ] Database credentials rotated
- [ ] CORS_ORIGIN set to your domain only
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate valid
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Regular backups tested
- [ ] Access logs enabled

---

## Testing for Vulnerabilities

### Run Local Security Checks
```bash
# Check dependencies
npm audit

# Run security linter
npm run lint:security

# Type check (prevents many runtime errors)
npm run type-check

# Run all tests
npm run test
```

### Third-Party Tools
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io) - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) - Penetration testing
- [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) - Outdated packages

## Security Headers

We set these security headers:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow these principles:
1. **Confidentiality** - Your report is private until patch is released
2. **Transparency** - We communicate progress honestly
3. **Timeliness** - We prioritize security fixes
4. **Recognition** - We credit reporters (with permission)

## Past Security Issues

| Date | Type | Severity | Status |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| N/A | - | - | No reported vulnerabilities |

*When vulnerabilities are reported and fixed, they will appear here with CVE details.*

---

## Community Security

If you discover a vulnerability in a **dependency** used by ORUS Builder:

1. **Report to that project first** (follow their security policy)
2. **Then notify us** so we can update

For vulnerabilities in **deployed ORUS Builder instances**:
- Contact your hosting provider's security team
- Report to us with instance details
